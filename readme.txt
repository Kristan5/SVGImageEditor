"Execute query"

This is where I have 6 queries. All files represents the 1st query, files in period represents the 
2nd query and so on. For some of the queries you might have to enter a starting and ending date, N amount of files
you would like to view, or range of number of shapes you would like to see.

All of the queries work.
